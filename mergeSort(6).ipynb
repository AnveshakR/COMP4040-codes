    "# Divide and Conquer \n",
    "\n",
    "Divide and conquer is a common technique in algorithm designs. The idea is to break the original problem into subproblems of the same kind with smaller sizes, and keep breaking subproblems into subproblems of even smaller sizes until the size of a subproblem becomes so small that it's trivial to solve it. Then combine solutions to subproblems to form a solution to larger subproblems and keep on doing this combining business until a solution to the original problem is found. "

    "# Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at one of the simplest divide and conquer algorithm called merge sort. The task is to sort a list of numbers. This time we take a different approach. We keep dividing the list into halves until each subproblem only consists of one number, which is sorted. Then we keep merging sorted sublists into longer sorted lists until the original list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the divide part is straightforward. The conquer part (merging two sorted sublists into one longer sorted list) requires some work, but still quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two sorted lists, both in ascending order. To merge $L_1$ and $L_2$ into a sorted list $L$, we compare $L_1[0]$ and $L_2[0]$, if $L_1[0] \\leq L_2[0]$, then place $L_1[0]$ into $L[0]$, and repeat the same procedure on $L_1[1]$ and $L_2[0]$. The case that $L_1[0] > L_2[0]$ is handled similarly: Place $L_2[0]$ into $L[0]$ and repeat the same procedure on $L_1[0]$ and $L_2[1]$. Keep doing this until we reach the end of one list. We append the remaining numbers of the other list to $L$ in the same their order.\n"
