Instead of selecting at random a pivot from $A[p..r]$, in practice, we may simply use the leftmost or the rightmost element as the pivot. For example, let us use $A[r]$ as the pivot and a pointer ptr initially set to $p$. For each number in $A[p..r-1]$, if it is less than the pivot then swap the number and the pivot and increase the pointer by 1. At the end, swap the pivot $A[r]$ with $A[ptr]$, where $q$ is the value of the pointer.\n",

    "The time complexity depends on whether the partition component of the algorithm separates the current array into two subarrays of proximately the same size. If it is, then the running time of quick sort can be determined by the following recurrence relation:\n",

    "However, in the worst case of partitioning, one subarray may always end up with only 1 element each time, leading to the worst-case complexity of $\\Theta(n\\cdot n) = \\Theta(n^2)$ because partitioning $A[p..q]$ takes $\\Theta(q-p) = \\Theta(n)$ time and\n",
    "the number of partitioning is $(q-p)/2 = \\Theta(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the performance of quicksort is to use randomization. We can do so in two ways: (1) Perform random permutation on the input array each time. (2) Sample at random from the input array a pivot. With minor modifications to the Python code above, it's straightforward to implement these two modifications, which are left to you to work it out.
